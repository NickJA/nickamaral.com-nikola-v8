Backup Research for Post
================================================

**Last Updated:** March 10, 2019

Overview
--------

This guide is a place for me to document my current backup process for data

Irreplaceable Data
------------------

Irreplaceable Data will have its main folder on my Windows Server, 
with a one for one backup to another physical drive in the same server, 
an offsite backup at a family members 10 miles away, and a cloud backup
to Google Drive.


- Code - All code will be created primarily on Windows within my OneDrive folder.  OneDrive will be synched across my devices and the cloud.  This will also be backed up with all other irreplaceable data according to my 1,2,3 policy.
- My Photos - Photos from my iPhone are automatically backed up to Google Photos, and synced to a Google Photos folder on my Google Drive. From here they are backed via 3, 2, 1 strategy.  Photos are also backed up to Amazon Cloud Photo.
- Wife's Photos - My wife organizes her photos separately, uploads them to our home server from her laptop.  From here I back them up on the normal 3, 2, 1 strategy.
